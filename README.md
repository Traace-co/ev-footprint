# EV Footprint

## What is it?

This simulator is based on the latest studies and we built it to:
* simply compare carbon emissions through their lifecycle of most common types of cars.
* break down misconceptions about the electric car.
* help you estimate if you should switch to an electric vehicle.

## Who created this tool?

This simulator was originally created as a side project by team members of [Tennaxia](https://tennaxia.com).
At Tennaxia, we help companies to effectively manage their sustainability, ESG, Carbon and EHS operations, measure their impact and achieve concrete progress.

## Is it really open source?

Yes. We believe that trust and transparency go together, and we want the model and the hypotheses to be as transparent as possible.

## How can I contribute?

Just open an issue in the project and describe the issue that you are facing or the feature request that your suggest. The project administrators will discuss it with you.
