    <Paragraph>
      The use of cars is one of the major sources of emissions on a national and individual scale. The objectives set internationally with the Paris agreements require us to question our uses and the possible alternatives to traditional mobility. In line with the findings of Carbone 4, Transport & Environment and the Paul Scherrer Institute, for a primary vehicle, the electric vehicle is less emissive than its thermal equivalent, even in countries with a more carbon intensive energy mix than France.
      Except in the case of secondary vehicles (which drive an average of 3,000 kilometers per year), it is therefore useful for the purpose of reducing emissions to promote the use of electric cars rather than gasoline-powered cars. However, this transition raises other societal and geopolitical questions, which Carbone 4 attempts to answer in this comprehensive FAQ: Preconceived ideas about electric cars.
